# Speech typing

- activate by pressing both left and right CTRL keys
- input spoken text by pressing the two keys again
- abort by pressing both shift keys

- Users need to customize the find keyboard method for their own model
- A2DP bluetooth devices are toggled to HSP during recording. May want to disable this depending on setup
